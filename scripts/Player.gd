#- Make it to where if a ramp is too steep, don't let the character run up it at all in the first place.
#- Check shaking of character when on a moving platform.
#- Ladders?
#- The second to last thing I need to do is create a seperate, optimized version of this script.
#	- This script will be for teaching, and the optimized script will be for actual use.
#	- I don't know if I will actually teach how to optimize the script, in the wiki/manual. I'll ahve to see.
#	- Maybe I need to change the order in which things work? That is, change the order of jumping, falling, moving, etc.
#		- I might need to put all of the "for Slide in range(get_slide_count()):" loops together, so it doesn't have to loop through them all several times.
#	  		That would take a lot of time. And I'm not sure it would work. I'll just have to see.
#- Lastly: make documentation for everything.

#				NOTES					#
#########################################
#- The collision safety margin must be set to at least 0.01 for the player's kinematic body, or else things like walking up steps and such will not work correctly.
#	- You'll need to test it and find out what works whenever you change the size of the player's collision shape.
#- This script is made with the intent that the player's collsion shape is a capsule.

#The crest factor and it's half in handy variables.

#	The half crest factor, as far as 2D and 3D character movement and surface normals go, makes the velocity of the character correct when walking diagonally.
#	The way it works is this: imagine the player pressed both forward and right at the same time (in a 3D first-person game). He is facing forward/north in global
#	space. And let's say the base walk velocity is just 1. The final velocity without the crest factor taken into effect is (1.0, 0.0, -1.0) in Godot. This may
#	sound correct, but think about this: what is it when the player is facing exactly 45 degs clockwise, or NW and he presses both forward and right?

	#	GET ROTATION-DIRECTION NORMALS	#
	#####################################
	#Get the direction the player is facing in normalized vectors.
	#	Look at the first example, which is commented out as it is unessecary; the one that says "Example of manual code:" below.
	#		Notice the first variable in the "DirectionInNormalVec3_FWAndBW" 3D vector.
	#		As you can see, it has "sin(get_rotation().y)" in it. What does this mean?
	#	Break down this formula into the simpiliest parts you can. Breaking things down to it's simpilest parts is the basis of all sciences.
	#		This is how people throughout history have figured things out, even complicated problems.
	#	So, according to this philosophy, "sin(get_rotation().y)" is 3 parts: a "sin()" sine function, a "get_rotation()"
	#		function, and the "y" variable of that "get_rotation()" function.
	#	So that means that "get_rotation().y" gets the global rotation of the node that this script is currently attached to.
	#	"get_rotation().y" is in radians. Let's say the character is looking straight ahead according to global space.
	#		That is, "get_rotation().y" equals "0".
	#	So, now that we have that, find the sine of that number. This also equals 0.
	#		This is a hard-to-understand thing for begginers, but it's not complicated.
	#		It's just one of those things that are difficult to get into your brain, but once it's there you've got it.
	#	So what does that result mean? Practically speaking, the "0" in the sine function tells us how much the character is
	#		looking along the X axis.
	#	It says "0" because we are not looking along the X axis at all, but we are actually looking along the Y axis
	#		according to global space. But, if we were looking 90 degrees right in global space, our result would be "1",
	#		because we are completely looking along the positive X axis in global space. We are not facing N or S, but E.
	#	Now remember, this is all done in radians, as they are faster in computers because they are native to mathematics.
	#	So when I mentioned degrees, it was simply for your easy understanding. 
	#	Let's say we are looking 45 degrees to the right. This is ~0.7853rads (look up how to convert degrees to radians and
	#		vice versa). The sine of that ("sin(0.7853)") is about "0.7070". This means we are looking along the +X axis about 70%.
	#	Then you do this with the other axies according to the function that you should use (sin() or cos()).
	#	This way, when we add velocity to the character, the velocity will be multiplied 0.7070 along the X axis, and he will
	#		we walking straight relative to the player direction. If you didn't do this, when you press forward it will be according
	#		to global space, and it will not take into account the direction the player is facing.
	#	This is triginometry, and you'll have to look elsewhere for a tutorial or information on that, as this comment is too long
	#		as it is. And I don't think it's very clear, either.
	#	Remember that this is trigonometry, so you have to think in 90 degree (right) angles.
	#	Basically, the sine of an angle is how long the opposite side is compared to the hypotenuse. Go find some pictures related to 
	#		trigonometry.
	#Example of manual code:
	#DirectionInNormalVec3_FWAndBW = Vector3(sin(get_rotation().y), 0, cos(get_rotation().y))
	#DirectionInNormalVec3_LeftAndRight = Vector3(cos(get_rotation().y),0,sin(get_rotation().y))
